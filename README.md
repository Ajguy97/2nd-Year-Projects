# OOP -  Data Structures & Algorithms - Tree Traversals Assignment
Given a method for in-order traversals I implemented our own code for pre-order, post-order traversals and breadth-first traversals. Verified that the code was working by printing out each node as it was visited. 
# OOP -  Data Structures & Algorithms - Sorting Algorithms Analysis
Given Insertion Sort, Shell Sort and Quick Sort Algorithms I performed a sequence of experiments to compare the performance of the three algorithms on arrays of different sizes to complement the theoretical analysis presented in my lectures.

Used Microsoft Excel to store the data and create graphs to compare the sorting algorithms. Then used Microsoft Word to comment on my findings.
# Networks and Data Communications - TCP Protocol Analysis using Wireshark - Assignment
Traced TCP segments sent and received from downloading a large file from a server to my computer. We then answered questions related to TCP providing screenshots of our findings.
# Nextgen II - Digital Media & 2D Games in Java
Created 3 Games using Jframe class in Java - 
*Game similar to Space Invaders
*Game of Life
*Bad guy vs Good guy using Pathfinding Algorithm
 
 Source code available in "Nextgen II - Digital Media & 2D Games in Java" Folder.
